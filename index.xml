&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my site design several times since the last post, and this time it&amp;rsquo;s even simpler!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to First Apartment Essentials</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/how-to-first-apartment-essentials/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 19:48:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/how-to-first-apartment-essentials/</guid><description>&lt;p>So this was the first year I lived in an apartment by myself and I wanted to create a list of essentials that I found particularly helpful to have the first time living in an apartment.

In this installment, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly explain how RAM, Hard Drives, and CPUs work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to GitHub CDN</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/how-to-github-cdn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 21:55:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/how-to-github-cdn/</guid><description>&lt;p>I found out how easy it was to use &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com"

I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain each step as I did and what some alternatives could be. Any questions? Feel free to tweet at me &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/thinkaliker"

&lt;p>To clarify: this wishlist is things I wish to have but not necessarily want given to me. If you insist on getting me something for some odd reason you can use the Amazon wishlist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case I forget or didn&amp;rsquo;t write it here, I have an Amazon wishlist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wishlist 2014</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/wishlist-2014/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2014 22:18:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/wishlist-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>2016 Edit: I figured I&amp;rsquo;d keep this in as a time capsule to see what I wanted in 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this exact moment, I can&amp;rsquo;t concentrate on homework, it&amp;rsquo;s Saturday night, and I have a headache. So what better time to make a wishlist? Sorted from least to most expensive and not sorted by practicality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been asked for what is something I want, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to give anyone a definitive list. Until now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm in college!</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/im-in-college/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 11:52:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/im-in-college/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m in college now!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That means I&amp;rsquo;ll have less time to do stuff on my own, but I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be learning more things in the process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A lil bit of Minecraft history</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/a-lil-bit-of-minecraft-history/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 10:19:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/a-lil-bit-of-minecraft-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you the history behind the Minecraft multiplayer server that I play on, AuroraServer! But the story isn&amp;rsquo;t quite that simple.

I updated the AuroraServer website as well, and it definitely works a lot better. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely liking Bootstrap the more I use it. Highly recommend it.

&lt;p>Sure, it was a fun experiment to do, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really expandable and the more I tried to add to it, the more crowded and messy looking it got.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 22:08:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/blog/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh hey!

Also a real life person!
I do things on the computer for fun, like programming, editing videos, making music, playing video games, animating things, and designing things.
I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside.
In real life, I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer by trade (check LinkedIn for more details). I also dabble in hiking, photography, and running.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://thinkaliker.com/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thinkaliker.com/links/</guid><description>Twitter
