-the future is technology and if you arent keeping up you should be worried

-don't be afraid to learn technology, everyone will move in that direction, its inevitable, you are not better than technology

-don't be afraid to ask for help - you will not get laughed at because you don't know how to do something. you will get laughed at for not being willing to learn how to do something.

-companies like microsoft, google, apple have spoiled us with easy to use interfaces, so easy that you don't realize how much work goes on behind the scenes - having the very minimal understanding of what happens will make it leagues easier to learn technology

-saying "i'm bad with computers" is a terrible mentality - no one can be "good" at computers but you have to know how to learn computers

-computers are not hard, it's the mental state of learning something new that's hard

-companies like to scare you "brand new malware" "watch out for hackers" into buying their products or scaring you into this mentality of don't trust the computer. put trust in the computer, not other people.
