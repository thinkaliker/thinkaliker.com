The internet is a scary, dangerous, and wonderful place. Here are some basic tips that I've rounded up to help you stay safe on your journeys around the interwebs. Hopefully it will be easy to understand and useful in your travels. Good luck.

I am not endorsed by any of the companies or products I mention in this post, but I do use many of them. Of course, you should always do your own research, and [never believe anything you see on the internet](http://thinkaliker.com/blog/how-to-basic-internet-security#trust-no-one)

## Don't Reuse Passwords

The best advice that anyone can give you is to not reuse passwords.

[Have I Been Pwned?](http://haveibeenpwned.com) and should you trust Troy Hunt? [It](https://www.troyhunt.com/im-sorry-but-your-email-address-is-not/)[depends](https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs)

## Little Green Lock

Are you planning on making a purchase online? Logging in to your account on any website? Here's one thing you should do: **look for the green lock icon in your address bar**.

And no matter what the website tells you, being "Norton Certifed Secure" does absolutely nothing to protect you, or your information.

## Adblock

You might think you need adblock so ads don't annoy you, but that's actually a side-effect of it's more important purpose. Ads might be annoying but you see them all the time anyway, on TV, in newspapers, or on billboards. But what those advertisments don't give you is the flu.

A new breed of internet attacks are popping up, and those include malicious code piggybacking on ad networks. Because they're often difficult to detect and in many cases the ad network is not able to remove it in time, "malvertising" can often spread quickly and easily due to the prevalence of ads on every website.

Adblock protects you by blocking most ad networks (and thus removing [mostly] ads as a consequence) to protect you from malicious intent.

## Update, Update, Update

Keep all of your software, phones, devices and web browsers up to date with the latest version. This is really important because of attacks known as "0-day" attacks. This means that at the time it is discovered/disclosed to the public, companies have not yet fixed the problem and so it is "day 0" of it being an issue for everyone involved. As soon as companies patch and fix the issue, they will (usually) push the update out to consumers and it is your duty to keep it up to date.

Naysayers will complain about Windows 10 and all the "spying" that Microsoft does. However, compared to Windows 7, 10 brings a lot of behind-the-scenes security updates and is more secure as a result. People can get really touchy about the subject, so all I will say is you _should_ update to Windows 10, and if you stay on Windows 7 you better hope that January 2020 is far enough away for you not to get hit.

## Avoid Norton

There are lots of variants of antivirus that really don't do...anything. Norton, McAfee, and many others are just sitting on your computer and just taking up computer resources and being a general waste of space.

## Don't Randomly Click

## Avoid Chains

> Bill Gates will give $100 to all the people who forward this email to 10 other people

Sound familiar? No? How about this?

> Due to the fact that Facebook has chosen to involve software that will allow the theft of my personal information, I state: at this date of _insert date here_ response to the new guidelines of Facebook, pursuant to articles _blah blah blah_. I declare that my rights are attached to all my personal data, drawings, paintings, photos, video, texts etc. published on my whatever

Better safe than sorry? **WRONG.**

Not only are these claims [untrue](http://www.snopes.com/computer/facebook/privacy.asp), people who post these without any research into the topic are putting themselves at risk. One of the greatest risks in keeping yourself safe on the internet is not you, but your friends. Assuming, of course, you have already taken proper steps to secure yourself.

What's the best way to break into somewhere? Usually, find the weakest link and break it, yes? 

Have you ever received an email claiming that s are in your area? Or you should buy some prescription medication? 

## Read This

This entire post was designed to be easy to digest. However, there's a whole world out there on the topics of internet security. A companion article I'd like to recommend to this post is [this article on Decent Security](http://decentsecurity.com/#/how-you-get-infected/). It explains several ways you can get in trouble, and served as an inspiration and a basis for this post.

## Trust No One

Trust no one, not even this post. Congratulations, you made it to the end! But why should you believe anything you see in this post as fact? The answer is that you shouldn't. You should, as a person who uses a device that can access the internet, do your own research. I've done my own research and I figured that the information was valuable enough to provide to everyone, but what if I'm wrong? While there are certainly people who could explain this better or recommend better practices, my word and theirs should not be taken as an end-all statement on how things should be done.

Use some sense, a little bit of instinct, a smidge of intuition, and trust no one.
