quote from the Box short (arther c clarke i think)
magic (service)
copperfield's email trick in vegas
amazon

When does technology stop being technology and start becoming magic?

Some time ago, I watched this short created by Bot & Dolly.

While the use of technology was fairly impressive, the closing quote stuck with me for a while.

**Sir Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law**

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

I mulled it over a bit, considered it interesting and true, and moved on.

However, as time went on, I slowly realized the significance of this quote.

How often do you use a piece of technology and not realize the amount of development, research, innovation, iteration, testing, scrapping, designing, or manufacturing that goes into it?
