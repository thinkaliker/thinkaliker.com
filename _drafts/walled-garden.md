it's got some walls and it looks nice
everything is kept well, and no one gets in, no one leaves much either
but ignorance is bliss, and for most, don't notice
in fact some would say that their garden is better than yours

so in terms of apple
apple controls their entire ecosystem, from the phone, to the software, to the apps, to the computer, to the apps on the computer, and so on
all the apple products can talk to each other perfectly fine
but talking to other ones is significantly more difficult
that's leaving the garden

and why would you want to leave the garden when it's perfectly fine here?

the meaning changes depending on what you're talking about, but for those two, those are just part of the garden wall
say you wanted a nice large clock in the middle of your icons, a widget
well apple says you can't, so you can't
you're stuck in the garden

Why do they want to control the garden so heavily?
literally because Apple - in the least sarcastic way possible

they've done a very good job of providing themselves as a "quality" and "thing to have" brand
so people associate them with value
thats why all the celebrities use iphones and macs
and when apple bought beats, man that was such a good move
people say they're easy to use, and I agree...up to a point

the point at which you want to leave the walled garden, wow, look at how high the walls are
Why does the wall get higher.
it's already pretty high, doesn't need to go much higher

I think the part that confuses me is because of how I feel; I constantly swap and go between everything
yes, but you're already just a visitor to the garden
that's more than most people in it
think about it, people who have macbooks usually have iphones, yes?
sure, but in order to use your iphone you need itunes
and you HAVE to use itunes
guess what works better on a mac? itunes
it should, there's literally no reason for it not to work better

so people who buy into the ecosystem are essentially trapped if there's nothing pointing them to the exit
and people, for example, like you, who experiences life outside the garden, should be able to see the good and bad of both leaving and staying in the garden

yes, but if all you see is the four walls of your garden and nothing else, how do you know that it's better/worse on the outside without checking?
especially if the walls are really high
