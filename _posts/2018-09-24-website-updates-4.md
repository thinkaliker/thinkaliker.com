Phew, my last blog post was from 2 years ago? Let's fix that.

Some news: I'm working on an online markdown editor. Hopefully this allows for more frequent writing. I've always wanted to sit at a coffee shop or something and just write away. Blog posts, short stories, who knows! I have this Chromebook and I'd like to use it more. It just sits in the corner and collects dust unless I want to be away from my desktop. And hey, might as well make mnml useful for me (rather than just using Word or Google Docs), and allow me to either publish/post/draft up posts for this blog. I just have to figure out how to handle backend/posting and we'll be good to go.

In other news, I just learned how to automate website building with TravisCI, Jekyll, and Github Pages. Might have to look more into this capability in the future.

I've got 5 or so posts in the pipeline (which I accidentally deleted but luckily was able to retrieve with Recuva). They are in varying states of polish and completion. And misinformation. Especially the security one. Especially after I received Security+ certification.

Now that I think about it, I've not been able to automate posting about new blog posts. I think Webhooks+IFTTT needs a second looking into.
