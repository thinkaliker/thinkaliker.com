I updated from Bootstrap 2.x to 3.0, and I will say it does look better. I updated the AuroraServer website as well, and it definitely works a lot better. I'm definitely liking Bootstrap the more I use it. Highly recommend it. (http://www.getbootstrap.com)

I reconfigured my links page so that they were how I originally intended (I don't know why I didn't think of tables in the first place, or why I didn't bother to check if Bootstrap had tables), and added a fancy YouTube subscribe button.

Aside from that, not much has changed...so yeah

If you want to see what the old homepage looks like, let me know and I'll send you a screenshot. I might post it later, actually.
