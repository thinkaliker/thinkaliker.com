<h2 class="">About <small>(Stuff about me)</small></h2>


I'm just this guy on the internet. Also a guy in real life!



I do things on the computer for fun, like programming, editing videos, making music, playing video games, animating things, and designing things.



I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside.



In real life, I'm a software engineer by trade (check LinkedIn for more details). I also dabble in hiking, photography, and running.



I have a lot of links and stuff to look at. If you want to talk to me find me at any of of my social media pages on the links page and get in contact with me! I'm usually pretty good about responding. Usually.



If I have ever helped you, feel free to throw some Dogecoins this way! Or whatever. I can send you coins too if you want. I dunno. Tell me when you do. <small>DDoTjX1Zgp7CnSFhXjYeWeTdujbTgF6Wix</small><br/>
