description: My wishlist made for 2015!
---

I made a wishlist last year, and ended up buying a lot of the items on the list, so I figured a new wishlist was in order.

To clarify: this wishlist is things I wish to have but not necessarily want given to me. If you insist on getting me something for some odd reason you can use the Amazon wishlist.

In case I forget or didn't write it here, I have an Amazon wishlist.

## Physical Items

- Various internet shirts (yup, still. Can never have too many awesome designed shirts)
- Server hosting [$???/mo] (I can't rely on free servers all day although not having to pay is nice - preferably US based)
- Various car upgrade parts (I have an Amazon wishlist somewhere - LED ALL THE THINGS)
- Still want a good mic but maybe one I can take around or something
- XKCD's What-If book
- XKCD's Up goer 5 poster
- TODO: update this later

## Unmonetizable  items

- Good grades would be nice
- Less distractions
- More time
- Android 5.0 on my phone (HTC/T-mo plz)
- A girlfriend? Haha funny joke 10/10
