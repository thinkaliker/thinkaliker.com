I like helping people. It feels good to help people.

I do believe that everyone should help people. And not in the sense that you have to go out and do 50 thousand hours of volunteer work or donate $1 million but the little things. (I mean you can donate tons of money and do lots of volunteer work too, no one's stopping you).

I like making people happy. It makes me happy to see people happy. It's the little things, making a (usually stupid) joke, hanging out, keeping company, whatever. It makes me sad when people are sad and it's the worst when I can't do anything about it.

There's the super obvious thing of doing stuff like trash cleanup and stuff, but that's more of helping the environment or whatever. It's still a good thing to do, don't get me wrong, but I just don't get as much personal satisfaction. But as an Eagle Scout it's kinda out of habit now.

But if I can help someone by giving them some advice or making some absolutely stupid off-hand comment which makes them laugh, then I will be satisfied.

I'm not really sure why I wanted to write this down. I kept thinking about it and wanted to get my thoughts out somewhere. Maybe I'll do a technical write up next or something.

Maybe I should vlog.
