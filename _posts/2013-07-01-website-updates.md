description: The first website update!
---
So I redid my website design.

Sure, it was a fun experiment to do, but it wasn't really expandable and the more I tried to add to it, the more crowded and messy looking it got.

So I scrapped it completely and moved over to the framework provided by Twitter Bootstrap.

It's a handy little system with built in layouts that are simple to use, and well documented.

I'm probably going to keep tweaking and modifying the look of my website until I'm happy with it.

PyroCMS pissed me off for not being well documented at all and the updated system so...WordPress time!
