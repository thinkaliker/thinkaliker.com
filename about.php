  <h2 class="">About <small>(Stuff about me)</small></h2>
  <p class="lead">I'm just this guy on the internet. Also a guy in real life!
    <br/>
    <br />I do things on the computer for fun, like editing videos, making music, playing video games, coding things, animating things, and designing things.
    <br />
    <br />I am currently studying at the University of California, Riverside, for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I hope to obtain my Masters degree in Computer Science as well.
    <br />
    <br />Other than that I have a lot of links and stuff to look at, and if you want to talk to me find me at any of of my social media pages on the links page and get in contact with me!</p>
  <p>If I have ever helped you, feel free to throw some Dogecoins this way! Or whatever. I can send you coins too if you want. I dunno. I have a PayPal thing too.</p>
