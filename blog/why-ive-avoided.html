      <p>You know, I’ve avoided it for a while. No, like, really avoided it. Like, I’ve gone out of my way to NOT see it.</p>

<p>“What the hell are you talking about get on with it”</p>

<p>Yes, of course. I’m talking, of course, about Japanese Anime. Why? What did you think I was talking about? Welcome to The Rant™.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I recently attended Anime Expo with some friends (while meeting up with some friends there) and it was a blast. I mean, a large portion of my time was spent waiting in lines or walking around in circles, but it’s the experience that counts. And I mean that. But, there was a problem.</p>

<p>You see, I haven’t actually watched anime. Yeah, that kinda becomes a problem when you go to Anime Expo. I’ve seen RWBY (created by the always fantastic RoosterTeeth Productions, most well known for their first-on-the-internet machinima series, Red vs. Blue), but I’m assuming a large portion of the “anime culture” wouldn’t classify it as Japanese anime, because it’s clearly not, it was made in Texas. But that’s what I’m here to talk rant about today.</p>

<h2 id="the-internet">The Internet</h2>

<p>I spend a majority of my free time in front of a computer. Fitting, as I am a computer science student. However, that also means I spend most of the time on the internet. And I have learned a few things from the internet, but that is for another time.</p>

<p>One thing to learn about the internet is that it’s definitely not as it seems. I’ll go on a tangent here, but it’s important.</p>

<p>One day, I discovered reddit. Now, reddit is a tricky beast of the internet. People post links to things, up or down vote content, and comment on things. Because anyone can sign up for an account and all actual comments are just text based, anyone can say anything they want. And so, you have no idea who anyone looks like.</p>

<p>BUT THEN, people start posting pictures. A weird thing about the internet is that people get excited over learning what people look like in real life. And for reddit, it probably looks like this: NSFW (it’s not bad, but you’ll get the picture) And that’s the unfortunate truth, is that everyone on the internet isn’t attractive. And that’s fine.</p>

<p>But here’s where it becomes a problem. (get back to the anime dammit) Reddit is the perfect place for discussion, learning new things, laughing at things, getting grossed out by things. But everyone’s entitled to an opinion and if you don’t agree with everyone’s opinion you’ll be downvoted out of existence. And thus, the reddit hivemind.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that the average demographic of reddit is 18-25 year old white males who are most likely unemployed. Which is the perfect demographic to target sad, lonely males. (why are you looking at me like that) And, thus, anime.</p>

<p>Anime is interesting, because it resonates well with this demographic. The only reason I talk about reddit in detail is because I am willing to bet that many of the guys in that picture watch anime.</p>

<p>The reason why I’ve avoided it for so long is because I don’t like being grouped (as I’ve said in a currently hidden blog post). People hear that you watch anime and I feel like you get immediately judged. I know because I do that. It’s terrible, I know. Fortunately, after being on the internet, my perspective has changed a bit. A good example of this is My Little Pony.</p>

<p>For some reason, MLP is also really really popular with the same age demographic. No one really knows why. (<em>cough 4chan cough</em>) But the same reasons apply. That’s really the only exception I’m making right now. I don’t get it. I just don’t. It’s a show for little girls. That ain’t right.</p>

<p>When you mention to someone that you watch anime, and you’re not Asian, many jump to the conclusion that you are a “weaboo” (I think I spelled it wrong but I don’t care), or an anime-obsessed white guy. I’m not trying to make the racist argument, and I’ll cover more about this demographic thing in the next section. But what I’m trying to say is that the internet, as anonymous as it is, is still judging. And no one likes being judged.</p>

<h2 id="the-culture">The “culture”</h2>

<p>Now, why is anime so popular? Let’s go back to the primary demographic of reddit. 18-25 year old males. So, guys in college/ending of high school. Let’s also look at that picture again. Actually no, let’s not, I want to stop looking at that picture.</p>

<p>I’m now going to judge VERY HARD. These guys are well known for wearing “fedoras” (actually trilbys get it right) and having neckbeards. I have no idea why that’s a thing, because as an Asian, sadly I do not have the ability to grow facial hair. I know that this probably isn’t most guys, but just mention the word anime in a group of people and see who responds.</p>

<p>Now, I know there are different types and genres of animes. Same argument goes for video games. So I will take the average. What’s your average video game? It probably has a main character who has some sort of power or weapon and defeats enemies. On average. So what’s an average anime? It’s either super dramatic, adventurous, or a guy in high school trying to get a girlfriend and failing to do so. And all of these are wrapped into the generalized “anime”.</p>

<p>But this demographic of 18-25 year old fedora-toting males will relate the most to, you guessed it, the guy in school trying to get a girlfriend.</p>

<p>“I’m doing everything right and girls still don’t like me”</p>

<p>Yeah. That guy.</p>

<p>Poor, disillusioned soul. I’m not saying that I’m personally any better, because I’m not. I still don’t have a girlfriend. That’s fine. But you can’t just say you’re doing everything right and girls don’t like you. There’s clearly something else wrong here.</p>

<p>I do think that the people who write these animes know this fact and capitalize on this fact. Write animes which cater emotionally so that more people will pay for it to feel like they relate to them. Good business strategy. But then you end up with people like this.</p>

<p>I mean, clearly, something is wrong here. That guy is from Japan - and he does this. Life ain’t anime, bro. And that’s my problem.</p>

<p>Life isn’t anime. You aren’t the guy just sitting in class asking why girls won’t notice you. I mean, you probably are, but through a sudden unexpected turn of events senpai isn’t going to notice you. It doesn’t work that way.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing. Animes have a really skewed perspective. Everyone relates to the main character, he’s more like you than you would like to be. But all of a sudden he gets courageous, or does something courageous and someone notices. Fine. But everyone else in the story is not real. These are not relateable characters. Sure, you might feel like “that guy” but no one is going to feel like “that girl”. At least, not with that attitude.</p>

<p>It can happen, I’m not saying there aren’t exceptions, but it’s so rare that you may as well forget it.</p>

<p>Lets observe an example. You’re an unemployed guy who is still living in your parent’s basement. You watch anime all day. You see the guy get the girl and you feel sorry for yourself. You wonder what you’re doing wrong in life and why no one likes you, I mean just look at the guy in the anime, he’s got no friends but suddenly he’s popular and has a girlfriend. You wonder why that hasn’t happened to you yet. You conclude that it will eventually and go back to eating Doritos™ and drinking Mountain Dew™.</p>

<p>That’s a terrible conclusion. And more importantly, very unrealistic expectations. You really think that’s going to happen? Sure, the guy in the story might get the girl, but who’s to say you can’t either? I mean, that’s the goal here.</p>

<p>Say you’re a guy in high school and really like anime. You’re that guy who sits by himself in the back of class, dresses in dark clothes, and is in the anime club. Everyone you know also likes anime and you guys feverishly discuss anime and the plots in your spare time. You have at least 2 body pillows and your walls are covered with manga. And you wonder why you don’t have a girlfriend yet. I’m not saying that anime is the reason, some girls like anime too, but obviously that’s not what you’re thinking. You’re like, I’ll try to get a girlfriend, and uselessly attempt to court some random girl who ends up thinking you’re just some creepy and smelly weirdo. At that point you either keep trying, rethink your entire life, or go back to the anime storyboard and see what happens next.</p>

<p>Now, full disclaimer, I am not either of these kinds of people. Thankfully. I’m sure you know someone who is, and, I got nothin’ to tell ya.</p>

<p>Anime will trick people, more often than not unknowingly, into having unrealistic expectations of other people. You obviously relate to the main character, so clearly everyone else has to be the same as all the other characters.</p>

<p>That’s my problem. I don’t want that to happen, although I feel like, personally, now that I’m aware of that, I can mentally prepare myself for it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I kinda distracted myself halfway through writing this rant so I kinda forgot what point I wanted to make aside from the complaints I have here.</p>

<p>I will say this though. I went to Anime Expo and got to see a world premiere of an anime called “Zankyo No Terror”, which more of a dramatic/action/intense sequence anime with bits of unexpected humor. I’m told this is a “psychological” anime, whatever that means. However, the story was interesting enough that I stayed to watch the first two episodes, which is what they showed. And I’ll probably continue watching.</p>

<p>I also just watched “Kids on the Slope” (I don’t have the name in front of me), which is similar to the “average” anime that I talked about where the guy tries to get the girl, yet I still enjoyed it. Yes, obviously the intention is to connect to the guy character, but you have to watch yourself and remember that it’s not real.</p>

<p>But what about all that stuff I just said?</p>

<p>I’m not backing down from what I said, but hear me out. You can either let anime control everything you do, or you can sit back and enjoy it as entertainment. That’s what I plan on doing. As for those completely obsessed, I mean, at least you have hobby, and that’s great, but I would really recommend a different hobby.</p>

<p>At least you have something you enjoy.</p>
