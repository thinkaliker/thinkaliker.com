      <p>TAKE WHAT IS WRITTEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. THIS IS KNOWN AS PERSONAL OPINION, AND I’D LIKE FOR YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU READ THIS.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>// WRITTEN 9/4/2013 // OPINIONS SUBJECT TO CHANGE//</p>

<p>As a self diagnosed introvert,I have only one thing to say about association: I’m really bad at it. Also that article is unrelated but I wanted to include it anyway.</p>

<p>I’ll give you a few examples.</p>

<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>

<p>[PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER ABOVE] In our AP Government class in high school, we took a test that would determine where on the political spectrum we placed, somewhere between Right and Left. I placed somewhere on the left (21/30). As much as this is a “liberal” or “Democratic” rating, I could honestly care less about sides. Here’s the thing: if I’m talking to someone about politics, I will most likely listen to their point of view before making any judgements about them. INCOMING PERSONAL OPINION - I believe that people should listen to what the other side has to say, and work on compromises. If we don’t do this (which we don’t) we’ll be stuck in gridlock forever and never get anything done. Even if society says that man should be persistent in what is “rightfully his”, this kind of behavior gets old fast, especially with two sides. You could remove parties altogether, but it would do no good, as factions are inevitable (you either agree with the guy or don’t. Or somewhere in between.)</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>

<p>[PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER ABOVE] Yes, I’m getting the touchy subjects out of the way first. Here’s the thing. Basic facts: My family for the most part is Buddhist, so by a technicality I would be Buddhist. However, as I have stated above, I’m terrible at association, and this is where it also applies. I personally do not associate myself with any religion or declaration of a lack of religion. Scientific studies have shown that children are influenced, or “conditioned” into who they are today by how they are raised when they were young. Funnily enough, I attended a Catholic based preschool for one year when I was very young. I don’t remember a thing from that preschool, except I had two friends who moved back to Japan. Never heard from them since. Anyway, this brings up an interesting point because I probably learned the basic Christian/Catholic/thingy teachings, without even realizing. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as most of societies standards are based upon a set of morals which date back to the really old times[citation needed]. But that means I grew up with a set of morals already in place, but no religious reinforcement to go with it. So I got the morals but not the beliefs. Going back to the Buddhist thing now. Today I look at Buddhist teachings, and as far as I’m concerned, it’s another set of perfectly good morals to live by. Again, I never received religious reinforcement in this area either, so I learned all of the good stuff without the deities involved. PERSONAL OPINION INCOMING - Religion isn’t a bad thing. I think it’s a good thing to have people follow a good set of morals to create a perfectly well balanced society. Heck, you could even remove the word “religion” entirely from this context. Why? Because if religion was just a set of morals that everyone followed, that would be called “society”. But since most religions involve a deity or two, people tend to believe whatever their religion tells them to. And if it keeps a society in order then so be it. I also believe that as a standing member of any religion, or none for that matter, you should always respect other people’s beliefs and opinions, even if they do not match your own. Talk to them, learn a bit about them, you might be surprised.</p>

<h2 id="ethnicity">Ethnicity</h2>

<p>[PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER ABOVE] Here’s a fun one. It’s a lot funnier than the first two, trust me. Ethnically, I am Chinese. But if you look at stereotypes, I’m a pretty bad Asian.</p>

<p>1) Grades: My grades coming out of high school were OK, but compared to some other people wasn’t that great. (3.9 weighted and I’m not even telling you unweighted) I took some AP classes but I only took SOME AP classes.</p>

<p>2) Test scores: Test scores (SATs), personally I say were pretty good. But that’s just me. Compare to some other “Asians” and man they weren’t that great. AP scores? Don’t wanna talk about that.</p>

<p>3) Extracurriculars: Stereotypical Asians will do tons and tons of outside activities and community service, leaving no time for social activities. I was the exact opposite. I didn’t do that many outside activities, I did do some community service, and my parents told me to be more social. Speaking of which…</p>

<p>4) Parents: My parents are not stereotypical Asian parents. For that, I am actually pretty thankful, because I probably wouldn’t be here writing this if it wasn’t for them. (Thanks mom and dad!) Grades not to great? Ah, you’ll do better next time, hopefully. Don’t have a girlfriend? WHY NOT? (I still don’t get this one, in fact, it’s the one thing my mom is most insistent about, again, being complete opposite of a stereotypical “Asian” parent)</p>

<p>5) Valedictorian: My friend David was the valedictorian. He is not Asian. But he sure acts like it. He did lots of extracurriculars, got good grades, complained about 99%s (not kidding), and was generally not street smart. (The truth hurts but we still like David) Oh, and his mom yells at him for not doing better. This guy is more Asian than I am!</p>

<h2 id="nerd">Nerd</h2>

<p>[PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER ABOVE] Another fun one. in today’s society, the term “nerd” has completely lost it’s meaning, as video games, computers, and the internet have become mainstream. But I like to stick with a more traditional definition of nerd - someone who either knows a lot about video games, knows a lot about computers, or knows a lot about a particular subjectin the STEM majors. I will admit it - I am a terrible nerd. I’ve never played any Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, or any “defining” games of any generation. I’ve played New Super Mario Bros and Tetris on my dad’s NES and that’s pretty much it. As for scifi movies, I’ve never seen any sort of Star Trek or Star Wars series, and I generally don’t watch TV. I do, however, still play video games and do stuff on the computer, so if that classifies me as a “nerd”, you may want to rethink that definition.</p>

<p>PERSONAL OPINION INCOMING - If you were offended by anything I wrote, please don’t be. You can’t make fun of other people unless you can make fun of yourself. And by that extension people who are ethnically related to you. Also please don’t be offended in anyway while reading this OPINION.</p>
