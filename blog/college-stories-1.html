      <p>So…where do I start. I have a very interesting roommate. It’s only the first quarter of college, and he’s already managed to creep out half the girls in our hall.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First, a bit of backstory. I used to worry that coming into college, I would be the kinda guy to sit in his room on the computer all day, not making any friends and being a shut-in. And my roommate would be the kind of guy to go out and socialize, make friends, etc. However, I quickly realized that this was in fact the exact opposite, and you will soon see why. Personally, I like making friends and being able to talk to them, and although I am a computer science major, I don’t want to spend all of my time on my computer.</p>

<p>A bit of setting: Our building is split into three suites, each with it’s own lounge. The three “suite lounges” are then connected together into a “hall lounge”. The hall lounge then connects to the “main lounge”, which is the lounge that connects the two buildings.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-guys-found-out">How the guys found out</h2>

<p>A few of us went out to lunch at one time and the topic of my roommate comes up. The two girls there began to tell us some stories, and here they are. We’ll come back to the lunch conversation afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="story-1">STORY 1</h2>

<p>This one isn’t as bad of a story, and it’s really more of an instance, but it’s important as detail. So one night on the first or second week, two girls decide to go out to get Starbucks. They ask if anyone want to go with them, and everyone but my roommate says no. The two girls then leave, and my roommate goes into the room to drop his stuff off. So by this time, they have left the room, and my roommate comes out of the door and asks if they have left. Someone says that they have, and he says that he’s going to tag along with them. Some 20 or so minutes later, they all come back with coffee, indicating that they actually did go to get coffee.</p>

<h2 id="story-2">STORY 2</h2>

<p>Again, this isn’t a story, and more of a one-off instance, but it’s also important, as these were told in the order at that one lunch. So, two different girls want to go to Knott’s Berry Farm for the Halloween event. They ask around, out of courtesy, and they also ask my roommate. He’s the only one who says yes, and they go to the amusement park. Now this isn’t really that weird, but I do remember asking him where he’s going on a Saturday night and he responded that he’s going to Knott’s Berry Farm, which I thought was really weird. But anyway, apparently on the ride back, he started talking about some really weird and creepy things like fate. Like, why would you talk about that? I mean, that’s really out of the blue, and out of character for him. Apparently, he’s involved with an organization who “knows who was behind 9/11” or something like that, and apparently has two sides, one good and one bad, and the good try to stop the bad from doing anything too drastic. This was pretty shocking to me as this wasn’t part of the story until about December, when I told this story again, and one of the people in this particular story elaborated on what happened.</p>

<h2 id="story-3">STORY 3</h2>

<p>We’re getting closer. A few days after the Knott’s incident, we went out to eat dinner. The two girls from the previous story declined to join us because my roommate was eating with us, but realized that they were hungry as well, so they came 30 minutes after we had gone to the dining hall. We finish eating, and we leave. Usually, we leave as a group, and we realize that my roommate isn’t with us. We stand around waiting a few minutes, but still no show. Since I have his cell phone number, I decide to call him.</p>

<p>“Hey, where are you? We’re waiting outside.”
“Uh, yeah, I’m not going with you guys.”</p>

<p>Thinking nothing of it, we left. The next day, one of the two girls asks one of the girls eating with us if we had ditched my roommate. Confused, the answer was no, we had even called him and he had told us that he wasn’t coming. As it turned out, he had spotted the two girls that he went with to Knott’s with, and told them that his friends had ditched him, and he was going to hang out with them for a bit. He even told them about the phone call with me, yet he said that we ditched him.</p>

<p>However, one of the girls later told me that this wasn’t the first encounter. He had been “coincidentally” meeting them at the dining hall over the last 3 or 4 days, saying “what a coincidence” and things like that. He then proceeded to sit down and talk to them about “fate” based off of a movie that he had seen. This seems out of order, but this specific paragraph should go before story 2 and before this one at the same time. This is also a late addition, so I wasn’t sure where to put it.</p>

<h2 id="story-4">STORY 4</h2>

<p>This is my favorite story to tell, not because of the story itself, but the drama involved with it. So one of my friends (again, a girl) needed to read an assignment. One thing to know about my friend is that she gets REALLY pissed off if you try to interrupt her while she is trying to get work done. And you don’t want her to yell at you because it’s really scary.</p>

<p>The current time is 3 AM during week 0/1, so none of us really knew each other at the time. That also means she couldn’t really call any of us to “escape” or something (it’s not that bad, trust me). So, she’s sitting in the hall lounge trying to read her homework assignment, He’s also there for some reason, and he’s on his computer. He looks up and says “Oh, you’re awake? I’m usually here by myself. This is my alone time.”. She asks him if he’s masturbating in the hall lounge (because why else would you call it alone time), and he responds, “Sorry, I can’t tell you.” She then responds that she needed to get her work done, so she couldn’t talk right now, and he responds that he respects that.</p>

<p>She then decides to try to leave, but just as she’s about to leave, he tells her that he can tell her, except that they have to hang out several times. At this point, she’s really weirded out, so she takes all of her stuff and heads to the main lounge. She sits down at a table and continues reading, but then for some reason he decided to follow her in and sits down at the same table she’s at. He then tries talking to her again (after she had said not to), and says “I thought you might want to know what I was doing on my computer”. Apparently he goes on the internet with his friends and “spreads positive messages”. Now, I’ve been on the internet for a while, but I still don’t know what that means.</p>

<p>She tries going back to work, but then he asks if she has any personal problems. (her aside here was that you shouldn’t ask a girl about her personal problems, especially at 3 in the morning.) He continues by saying that he has a personal method of solving people’s problems and that he can help her. (now my aside here is that I do too, but you don’t tell people that.)  At this point she gets REALLY pissed off and she proceeds to “shove all of her problems down his throat” (her words, not mine). He’s taken aback and says that he needs a moment to process that information. She then gathers all of her stuff and storms back to her room.</p>

<p>Her aside here is that she tried talking to him with an open mind, and walked away with a closed one. We agreed that was pretty reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="and-back-to-lunch">…and back to lunch</h2>

<p>So us guys were sitting there, a bit in shock. We had never seen this behavior before, and WE live with him. We came to the conclusion that it only affected girls, because none of us had experienced any of this.</p>

<p>Apparently he also has some of the same classes with the two girls from the Knott’s Berry Farm story, and somehow makes it a point to sit near them in class.</p>

<p>But as of writing this, he spends a lot more time in our room, either napping (aka. “thinking in bed with his eyes closed”), or playing League of Legends.</p>

<p>And that’s the story of my roommate so far. College isn’t over yet. Not even close. And I hope that I can bring more interesting stories to the table.</p>

<p>I am updating this as I tell this story to others, because every time I tell this story, I learn something new.</p>
